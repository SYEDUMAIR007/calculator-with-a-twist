## Overview
This challenge was TRICKY, creating the toggle button was a challenging task and i didnt had the figma or sketch files but im happy that i could make it as realistic as possible.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference


## My process
I first went on to design my own mockup of the design using figma and then built the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Java script


### What I learned
I understood vanilla js very well while creating this project.


### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me for buildin the mockup . I really liked this pattern of building mockups first and will use it going forward.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand the vanilla js.
